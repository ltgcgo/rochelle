On the road to the Everfree Forest, there used to be nothing conspicuous, until a sapling suddenly appeared close to the town after a new unassuming family had relocated there. No one for sure knew where the tree came from, they even didn't know what the tree was, but the flowers in the crest were gently diffusing pleasing fragrance.
The sapling appeared to be irresistant to any strong wind, however it grew steadily without much problem, despite the frequent assumptions from the town folks that it was getting toppled by a random gust. Months went by, with the giggles of Nightmare Night and the comfort of Hearth's Warming Eve dashing. Gone was the quilt of snow, came was the gentle embrance of the spring sun. The sapling stood strong, unmoving.
From time to time, a random colt started to appear under the growing sapling. Alone he was, moping while looking up at the crest at times, eyes flat as if he was deep in thought. Like the sapling itself, the colt was shrouded in mystery - No one knew why he's there or who he was, but no one was curious enough to check. They were in the weirdness magnet called Ponyville, after all.
